/**
 * The convention to use for WKT formatting.
 * This enumeration specifies whether to use the <cite>Well Known Text</cite> format defined by ISO 19162
 * (also known as “WKT 2”), or whether to use the format previously defined in OGC 01-009 (referenced as “WKT 1”).
 *
 * {@section WKT 1 variants}
 * The WKT 2 format should be parsed and formatted consistently by all softwares.
 * But the WKT 1 format has been interpreted differently by various implementors.
 * Apache SIS can adapt itself to different WKT variants, sometime automatically. But some aspects can not be guessed.
 * One noticeable source of confusion is the unit of measurement of {@code PRIMEM[…]} and {@code PARAMETER[…]} elements:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The unit of the Prime Meridian shall be the angular unit of the enclosing Geographic CRS
 *       according the OGC 01-009 (<cite>Coordinate transformation services</cite>) specification.</li>
 *   <li>An older specification — <cite>Simple Features</cite> — was unclear on this matter and has been
 *       interpreted by many softwares as fixing the unit to decimal degrees.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Despite the first interpretation being specified by both OGC 01-009 and ISO 19162 standards, the second
 * interpretation appears to be in wide use for WKT 1. Apache SIS uses the standard interpretation by default,
 * but the {@link #WKT1_COMMON_UNITS} enumeration allows parsing and formatting using the older interpretation.
