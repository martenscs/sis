/**
 * Base class for writing filtered characters to another {@link Appendable}.
 * This base class performs a work similar to the {@link java.io.FilterWriter} work,
 * except for the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The filtered output is sent to an arbitrary {@link Appendable} instead than
 *       to the {@link java.io.Writer} sub-type.</li>
 *   <li>No synchronization is performed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If needed, this {@code Appender} can be viewed as a synchronized
 * {@link java.io.Writer} by invoking the {@link IO#asWriter(Appendable)} method.
 *
 * {@section Flushing and closing the stream}
 * Subclasses implement the {@link java.io.Flushable} interface only if they
 * hold data in an internal buffer before to send them to the wrapped {@code Appendable}.
 * This is the case of {@link TableAppender} and {@link LineAppender} for instance.
 * For unconditionally flushing or closing an {@code Appendable} and its underlying stream,
 * see {@link IO#flush(Appendable)} and {@link IO#close(Appendable)}.
