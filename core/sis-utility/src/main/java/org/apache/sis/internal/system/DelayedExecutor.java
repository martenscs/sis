/**
 * A thread executing short tasks after some (potentially zero nanosecond) delay.
 * This thread is reserved to internal SIS usage - no user code shall be executed here.
 * All submitted tasks shall be very quick, since there is only one thread shared by everyone.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * In practice some user code may be indirectly executed, since some SIS tasks invoke overrideable methods.
 * We may need to revisit the {@code DelayedExecutor} design in a future version if the above happens to be
 * a problem. For example we may allow the user to specify an application-wide scheduled executor and delegate
 * the tasks to that executor.</div>
 *
 * The methods for use in this class are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #executeDaemonTask(DelayedRunnable)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #schedule(DelayedRunnable)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section Comparison with <code>java.util.concurrent</code>}
 * We tried to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} in a previous version,
 * but it seems more suitable to heavier tasks in applications controlling their own executor. For
 * example {@code ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} acts as a fixed-sized pool, thus forcing us to use
 * only one thread if we don't want to waste resources (profiling shows that even a single thread
 * has very low activity). The {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} super-class is more flexible but still
 * have a quite aggressive policy on threads creation, and doesn't handle delayed tasks by itself.
 * We could combine both worlds with a {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} using a {@code DelayedQueue},
 * but it forces us to declare a core pool size of 0 otherwise {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} tries
 * to execute the tasks immediately without queuing them. Combined with the {@code DelayedQueue}
 * characteristics (being an unbounded queue), this result in {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} never
 * creating more than one thread (because it waits for the queue to reject a task before to create
 * more threads than the pool size).
 *
 * <p>Given that it seems difficult to configure {@code (Scheduled)ThreadPoolExecutor} in such
 * a way that two or more threads are created only when really needed, given that using those
 * thread pools seems an overkill when the pool size is fixed to one thread, given that our
 * profiling has show very low activity for that single thread anyway, and given that we do
 * not need cancellation and shutdown services for house keeping tasks (this is a daemon thread),
 * a more lightweight solution seems acceptable here. Pseudo-benchmarking using the
 * {@code CacheTest.stress()} tests suggests that the lightweight solution is faster.</p>
 *
 * {@section Future evolution}
 * We may remove (again) this class in a future SIS evolution if we happen to need an executor anyway.
 * However it may be better to wait and see what are the executor needs. Setting up an executor implies
 * choosing many arbitrary parameter values like the number of core threads, maximum threads, idle time,
 * queue capacity, etc. Furthermore some platforms (e.g. MacOS) provide OS-specific implementations
 * integrating well in their environment. We may want to let the user provides the executor of his
 * choice, or we way want to have more profiling data for choosing an appropriate executor. But we
 * may need to find some way to give priority to SIS tasks, since most of them are for releasing
 * resources - in which case quick execution probably help the system to run faster.
 * However before to switch from the lightweight solution to a more heavy solution,
 * micro-benchmarking is desirable. The {@code CacheTest.stress()} tests can be used
 * in first approximation.
