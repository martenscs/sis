/**
 * Defines the structure (list of columns) of a table and provides the root of the tree

 * column contains a tree. Every row in this table is a {@link Node} instance, and each
 * node can have an arbitrary number of {@linkplain Node#getChildren() children} nodes.

 * <p>In many cases, the columns are known in advance as hard-coded static constants.
 * Those column constants are typically documented close to the class producing the
 * {@code TreeTable} instance. Using directly those static constants provides type
 * safety, as in the following example:</p>
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     TreeTable table = ...; // Put here a TreeTable instance.
 *     TreeTable.Node node = table.getRoot();
 *     CharSequence   name = node.getValue(TableColumn.NAME);
 *     Class<?>       type = node.getValue(TableColumn.TYPE);
 * }
 *
 * In the above example, the type of value returned by the {@link Node#getValue(TableColumn)}
 * method is determined by the column constant. However this approach is possible only when
 * the table structure is known in advance. If a method needs to work with arbitrary tables,
 * then that method can get the list of columns by a call to {@link #getColumns()}. However
 * this column list does not provide the above type-safety.
