/**
 * Surrounds double values by {@code <gco:Decimal>}.
 * The ISO-19139 standard requires most types to be surrounded by an element representing the value type.
 * The JAXB default behavior is to marshal primitive Java types directly, without such wrapper element.
 * The role of this class is to add the {@code <gco:…>} wrapper element required by ISO 19139.
 *
 * {@section Relationship with <code>GO_Real</code>}
 * This adapter is identical to {@link GO_Real} except for the element name, which is {@code "Decimal"} instead
 * than {@code "Real"}. This adapter is used for the {@code westBoundLongitude}, {@code eastBoundLongitude},
 * {@code southBoundLatitude} and {@code northBoundLatitude} properties of {@code EX_DefaultGeographicBoundingBox}.
 * The {@code GO_Real} adapter is used for about everything else.
