/**
 * High-level characteristics about the axes of a coordinate system.
 * This enumeration provides a convenient way to identify some common axes conventions like
 * (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) versus (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) axis order,
 * or [-180 … +180]° versus [0 … 360]° longitude range.
 *
 * <p>Enumeration values are inferred from the properties of given {@link CoordinateSystem} instances.
 * This enumeration does not add new information and does not aim to cover all possible conventions – it is
 * only a convenience for identifying some common patterns.</p>
 *
 * {@section Axis order}
 * The axis order is specified by the authority (typically a national agency) defining the Coordinate Reference System
 * (CRS). The order depends on the CRS type and the country defining the CRS. In the case of geographic CRS, the
 * (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) axis order is widely used by geographers and pilotes for centuries.
 * However software developers tend to consistently use the (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) order for every kind of CRS.
 * Those different practices resulted in contradictory definitions of axis order for almost every CRS of kind
 * {@code GeographicCRS}, for some {@code ProjectedCRS} in the South hemisphere (South Africa, Australia, <i>etc.</i>)
 * and for some polar projections among others.
 *
 * <p>Recent OGC standards mandate the use of axis order as defined by the authority. Oldest OGC standards used the
 * (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order instead, ignoring any authority specification. Many softwares still use the
 * old (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order, because it is easier to implement. Apache SIS supports both conventions.
 * By default, SIS creates CRS with axis order as defined by the authority. Those CRS are created by calls to the
 * {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.CRS#forCode(String)} method. The actual axis order can be verified after the CRS
 * creation with {@code System.out.println(crs)}. If (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order is wanted for compatibility
 * with older OGC specifications or other softwares, CRS forced to "longitude first" axis order can be created using the
 * {@link #RIGHT_HANDED} or {@link #NORMALIZED} enumeration value.</p>
 *
 * {@section Normalized coordinate systems}
 * <cite>Right-handed</cite> coordinate systems have a precise meaning in Apache SIS.
 * However SIS defines also <cite>normalized</cite> coordinate systems in a more heuristic way.
 * A similar concept appears in the Web Map Services (WMS) 1.3 specification, quoted here:
 *
 * <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>6.7.2 Map CS</b> —
 * The usual orientation of the Map CS shall be such that the <var>i</var> axis is parallel to the East-to-West axis
 * of the Layer CRS and increases Eastward, and the <var>j</var> axis is parallel to the North-to-South axis of the
 * Layer CRS and increases Southward. This orientation will not be possible in some cases, as (for example) in an
 * orthographic projection over the South Pole. The convention to be followed is that, wherever possible, East shall
 * be to the right edge and North shall be toward the upper edge of the Map CS.</font></blockquote>
 *
 * In addition to WMS, Apache SIS uses normalized coordinate systems in map projections.
 * More information are provided in the <cite>Axis units and directions</cite> section of
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.referencing.operation.projection map projection package}.
 *
 * {@section Range of longitude values}
 * Most geographic CRS have a longitude axis defined in the [-180 … +180]° range. All map projections in Apache SIS are
 * designed to work in that range. This is also the range of {@link Math} trigonometric functions like {@code atan2(y,x)}.
 * However some data use the [0 … 360]° range instead. A geographic CRS can be shifted to that range of longitude values
 * using the {@link #POSITIVE_RANGE} enumeration value. The choice of longitude range will impact not only some
 * coordinate conversions, but also the methods that verify the <cite>domain of validity</cite>
 * (e.g. {@link org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#normalize()}).
