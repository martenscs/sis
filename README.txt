=================================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <http://incubator.apache.org/sis/>
=================================================

Apache SIS(TM) is a spatial framework that enables better representation 
of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other 
relevant spatial needs.

Apache SIS is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted 
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, 
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful 
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed 
by the ASF.

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <http://www.apache.org/>.

Apache SIS, SIS, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache SIS
project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.

Getting Started
===============

SIS is based on Java 5 and uses the Maven 2 <http://maven.apache.org/>
build system. To build SIS, use the following command in this directory:

    mvn clean install


Tomcat Server (See much simpler Jetty integration below)
===============
The build consists of a number of components, including a web-based application
file (WAR) you can use to try out SISfeatures. You can run it on top of Apache Tomcat like this:

    /usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
    mkdir /usr/local/sis
    cd /usr/local/sis
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/target/sis-webapp-X.Y.war ./
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml ./sis.xml
    edit sis.xml (set the docBase to /usr/local/sis/sis-webapp-X.Y.war and the property 
          org.apache.sis.services.config.filePath to /usr/local/sis/sis-location-config.xml, 
          org.apache.sis.services.config.qIndexPath to /usr/local/sis/qtree, 
          org.apache.sis.services.config.geodataPath to /usr/local/sis/geodata)
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/src/main/resources/sis-location-config.xml ./
    edit sis-location-config.xml (add or delete GeoRSS URLs)
    ln -s /usr/local/sis/sis.xml /usr/local/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/sis.xml
    /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
    Visit http://localhost:8080/sis/demo.jsp and checkout the demo!    
    Try some queries:
    
    Bounding Box:
      0, 50, 50, 100
      
    Point Radius:
      0, 80, 400km
   
Jetty Server
===============
Jetty is now supported too (as of 02/11/2012). Simply build the project at the root level

	mvn clean install 

Then browse to the sis-webapp directory. To run the built-in Jetty server, type the command:

	mvn jetty:run
	
Visit http://localhost:8080/sis-webapp/demp.jsp and run the same queries as noted above.

    Bounding Box:
      0, 50, 50, 100
      
    Point Raidus:
      0, 80, 400km
