Apache SIS NetCDF storage

  Bridge between NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) convention and ISO 19115 metadata.

  NetCDF files can be read and written by the {{{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/}UCAR NetCDF library}}
  among others. The <<<sis-netcdf>>> module uses the UCAR library for fetching attribute values and information about
  coordinate systems, then associates those attribute to the corresponding elements in the ISO 19115 specification.


* Note on the definition of terms

  The UCAR library sometime uses the same words than the ISO/OGC standards for different things.
  In particular the words "<domain>" and "<range>" can be applied to arbitrary functions, and the
  UCAR library chooses to apply it to the function that converts grid indices to geodetic coordinates.
  The ISO 19123 standard on the other hand considers coverage as a function, and applies those <domain>
  and <range> words to that function. More specifically:

    * UCAR "<coordinate system>" is actually a mix of <coordinate system>, <coordinate reference system>
      and <grid geometry> in OGC sense.

    * UCAR coordinate system "<domain>" is not equivalent to ISO 19123 coverage domain,
      but is rather related to <grid envelope>.

    * ISO 19123 coverage <domain> is related to UCAR coordinate system "<range>".

    * ISO 19123 coverage <range> is not equivalent to UCAR "<range>", but is rather related to the
      NetCDF variable's minimum and maximum values.

  Care must be taken for avoiding confusion when using SIS and UCAR libraries together.
