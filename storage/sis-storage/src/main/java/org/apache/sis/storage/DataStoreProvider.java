/**
 * Provides information about a specific {@link DataStore} implementation.
 * There is typically one {@code DataStoreProvider} instance for each format supported by a library.
 * Each {@code DataStoreProvider} instances provides the following services:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Provide generic information about the storage (name, <i>etc.</i>).</li>
 *   <li>Create instances of the {@link DataStore} implementation described by this provider.</li>
 *   <li>Test if a {@code DataStore} instance created by this provider would have reasonable chances
 *       to open a given {@link StorageConnector}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section Packaging data stores}
 * JAR files that provide implementations of this class shall contain an entry with exactly the following path:
 *
 * {@preformat text
 *     META-INF/services/org.apache.sis.storage.DataStoreProvider
 * }
 *
 * The above entry shall contain one line for each {@code DataStoreProvider} implementation provided in the JAR file,
 * where each line is the fully qualified name of the implementation class.
 * See {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} for more general discussion about this lookup mechanism.
 *
 * {@section Thread safety}
 * All {@code DataStoreProvider} implementations shall be thread-safe.
 * However the {@code DataStore} instances created by the providers do not need to be thread-safe.

    /**
     * Indicates if the given storage appears to be supported by the {@code DataStore}s created by this provider.
     * The most typical return values are:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@link ProbeResult#SUPPORTED} if the {@code DataStore}s created by this provider
     *       can open the given storage.</li>

     * </ul>
     *
     * Note that the {@code SUPPORTED} value does not guarantee that reading or writing will succeed,
     * only that there appears to be a reasonable chance of success based on a brief inspection of the
     * {@linkplain StorageConnector#getStorage() storage object} or contents.
     *
     * <p>Implementors are responsible for restoring the input to its original stream position on return of this method.
     * Implementors can use a mark/reset pair for this purpose. Marks are available as
     * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer#mark()}, {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int)} and
     * {@link javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStream#mark()}.</p>

     * with the format, as in the following example:

     * {@preformat java
     *     public ProbeResult probeContent(StorageConnector storage) throws DataStoreException {

     *             // If StorageConnector can not provide a ByteBuffer, then the storage is
     *             // probably not a File, URL, URI, InputStream neither a ReadableChannel.
     *             return ProbeResult.UNSUPPORTED_STORAGE;
     *         }
     *         if (buffer.remaining() < Integer.SIZE / Byte.SIZE) {
     *             // If the buffer does not contain enough bytes for the integer type, this is not
     *             // necessarily because the file is truncated. It may be because the data were not
     *             // yet available at the time this method has been invoked.
     *             return ProbeResult.INSUFFICIENT_BYTES;
     *         }
     *         if (buffer.getInt(buffer.position()) != MAGIC_NUMBER) {
     *             // We used ByteBuffer.getInt(int) instead than ByteBuffer.getInt() above
     *             // in order to keep the buffer position unchanged after this method call.
     *             return ProbeResult.UNSUPPORTED_STORAGE;
     *         }
     *         return ProbeResult.SUPPORTED;

     * @param  storage Information about the storage (URL, stream, JDBC connection, <i>etc</i>).
     * @return {@link ProbeResult#SUPPORTED} if the given storage seems to be readable by the {@code DataStore}
     *         instances created by this provider.
