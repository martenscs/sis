/**
 * Provides convenience methods for working with a ({@link ReadableByteChannel}, {@link ByteBuffer}) pair.
 * The channel and the buffer must be supplied by the caller. It is okay if they have already been used
 * before {@code ChannelDataInput} creation.
 *
 * {@section Encapsulation}
 * This class exposes publicly the {@linkplain #channel} and the {@linkplain #buffer buffer} because this class
 * is not expected to perform all possible data manipulations that we can do with the buffers. This class is only
 * a helper tool, which often needs to be completed by specialized operations performed directly on the buffer.
 * However, users are encouraged to transfer data from the channel to the buffer using only the methods provided
 * in this class if they want to keep the {@link #seek(long)} and {@link #getStreamPosition()} values accurate.
 *
 * <p>Since this class is only a helper tool, it does not "own" the channel and consequently does not provide
 * {@code close()} method. It is users responsibility to close the channel after usage.</p>
 *
 * {@section Relationship with <code>DataInput</code>}
 * This class API is compatibly with the {@link java.io.DataInput} interface, so subclasses can implement that
 * interface if they wish. This class does not implement {@code DataInput} itself because it is not needed for
 * SIS purposes, and because {@code DataInput} has undesirable methods ({@code readLine()} and {@code readUTF()}).
 * However the {@link ChannelImageInputStream} class implements the {@code DataInput} interface, together with
 * the {@link javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStream} one, mostly for situations when inter-operability with
 * {@link javax.imageio} is needed.
